A story sharing platform that lets authenticated users to post about anything that's going on in their life with few simple steps. Users can create Public/Private stories, edit them once posted, delete them if not required. All the other users logged into the application can view the public stories.
Used OAuth2.0 framework for user authentication with help of passport.js library. Handlebars were used to dynamically render the pages.
